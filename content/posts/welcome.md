White clothes are a staple in everyone's wardrobe, but keeping them bright and stain-free can be a challenge. Over time, whites naturally yellow or turn grey. Here are 5 tips from the experts at FreshSpin Laundry to help you keep your whites looking brand new.

## 1. Wash Whites Separately
This is the golden rule! Even light-colored clothes can bleed onto your whites, causing them to look dull. Always sort your laundry and wash whites in their own load.

## 2. Treat Stains Immediately
Don't let stains set. Whether it's coffee, dirt, or sweat, treat the spot as soon as possible with a stain remover or a mixture of baking soda and water.

## 3. Use the Right Amount of Detergent
Using too much detergent can actually attract more dirt, as the residue acts like a magnet. Use the recommended amount for your load size.

## 4. Don't Overload the Washer
Clothes need room to circulate to get clean. Overloading the machine prevents water and detergent from reaching every part of the fabric efficiently.

## 5. Sun Dry When Possible
The sun is a natural bleaching agent. Hanging your white clothes outside to dry can help maintain their brightness without the need for harsh chemicals.
