Accidents happen. But a spill doesn't have to mean a ruined shirt. Here is the FreshSpin guide to emergency stain removal:

### The #1 Rule: Don't Rub!
Rubbing a stain pushes it deeper into the fibers. Instead, **blot** it with a clean white cloth to soak up as much liquid as possible.

### Common Stains & Solutions:
* **Coffee:** Rinse with cold water immediately. Apply a drop of liquid detergent and let sit for 5 minutes before washing.
* **Red Wine:** Cover with salt to absorb the liquid, then rinse with club soda or cold water.
* **Grease:** Apply dish soap (which breaks down oils) directly to the dry stain before putting it in the wash.
* **Ink:** Dampen a cloth with rubbing alcohol and blot carefully until the ink transfers to the cloth.

For the toughest stains, bring them to the pros at **Kahawa Wendani**!
