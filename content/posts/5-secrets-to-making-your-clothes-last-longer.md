Maintaining your clothes isn't just about washing them; it's about the small habits that prevent wear and tear. Here are five secrets from the experts at FreshSpin Laundry:

1. **Wash Less Frequently:** Unless clothes are visibly dirty or smelly, don't wash them after every single wear. Over-washing is the #1 killer of fabric fibers.
2. **Turn Inside Out:** Always wash your brightly colored or printed clothes inside out to prevent fading and cracking.
3. **Use Cold Water:** Most modern detergents work perfectly in cold water, which is much gentler on fabrics like cotton and wool.
4. **Air Dry When Possible:** High heat from dryers can shrink clothes and break down elastic fibers. Air drying is the safest way to maintain fit.
5. **Invest in Quality Hangers:** Wooden or padded hangers prevent "shoulder bumps" and maintain the structure of your jackets and shirts.
